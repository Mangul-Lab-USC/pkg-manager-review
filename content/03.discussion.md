### Existing problems with software distribution and installation

The installation process of bioinformatics research software is typically a multi-step process, starting with the end-user locating and downloading the software. 
Next is the actual installation, during which the end-user must determine what dependencies are missing and resolve them by installing the required software[5](https://paperpile.com/c/4vBDtY/kjwlC).
Even in cases where the end-user is familiar with this process, they are typically installing on high-performance clusters where they are constrained by user-level permissions that prevent them from following standard installation procedures.



- root access limitations
- reproducibility of findings
- version conflicts
- dependency resolution

### Definitions and explanations of distribution system types

#### Package Managers

Package managers first appeared nearly thirty years ago as software developers sought to automate the entire software installation process.
Each piece of software is packaged into a standard format called a package. 
While package managers use different package formats, all formats have the same basic structure, as shown in Figure @fig:package-schematic.

Though the exact contents varies between different package formats, all include the software and relevant metadata necessary to complete installation.

The metadata gives the package manager the necessary information to install the packaged software. 

To use a package manager, a user instructs the package manager to install software, then the package manager performs all the necessary steps to install the software as shown in Figure @fig:package-manager-usage.
Assuming the software is not already installed, the package manager retrieves the appropriate package from the repository, a server that stores all of the available packages.
The package manager then uses the package's metadata to determine what it needs to do to complete installation.
For most packages, this includes verifying the installation of all dependencies, which are other pieces of software that must be installed prior to the initial software being installed.

**Standard workflow for installing software via a package manager.**
The user, usually an admin, asks the package manager to install a specific piece of software. If the software is not already installed, the package manager fetches the approrpriate package from the repository. If any of the dependencies are not already installed, the package manager "loops" through the missing dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, the original software is installed.

The package manager verifies each dependency by confirming that the dependency is already installed or installing the dependency if it is missing. 
For missing dependencies, the package manager retrieves the dependency's package from the repository and starts the installation procedure for that package.
Once all the dependencies are installed, the initially requested software is installed. 
However, the package manager often goes through several iterations of this process because every dependency can have it's own list of dependencies, in which case each of the dependency's dependencies must be verified through the same process.

In most cases, the package manager is able to install all of the missing dependencies, but there are two relatively common problems that a package manager cannot overcome.
The first is circular dependencies, which occurs when software A has a dependency on software B and software B has a dependency on software A.
The package manager cannot install A without installing B first, but B cannot be installed without installing A first.
The second is conflicting versions, which occurs when software A and software B have the same dependency, but require different versions.
Since only one version of any software can be installed at a time, either A or B will not be able to have the correct version of the dependency. 

Some package managers are built-into the operating systems (e.g. APT), while others must be installed by users. Some package managers (e.g. Conda6) are programming language agnostic, while others are designed for a particular language (e.g pip10).

  - benefits for the developer
    - mature technology - higher degree of familiarity
    - allows dependency specification (including versions)
  -limitations for the developer
    - can't always use to install missing dependencies for end-user
  - benefits for the end-user
    - package size is minimal (dependencies aren't duplicated)
    - installs missing dependencies
  - limitations for the end-user
    - not always accessible (unless admin user)
    - can't install multiple versions of same software
- containerization
  - definition

  - benefits for the developer
    - include specific versions of dependencies
    - known running environment
      - fewer test variables
      - reproducibility of results
  - limitations for the developer
    - learn a new system instead of focusing on research
  - benefits for the end-user
    - no installation (except possible runtime)
    - no dependency issues
    - sandbox provides computer system security
  - limitations for the end-user
    - container size
    - duplication of dependencies
    - root access requirement to install runtime
    - configuration in cluster
- centralized repositories
  - definition
  - benefits
    - known download site
    - hosting is taken of
  - limitations
    - repo specific restrictions
