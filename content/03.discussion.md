### Existing problems with software distribution and installation

The installation process of bioinformatics research software is typically a multi-step process, starting with the end-user locating and downloading the software. 
Next is the actual installation, during which the end-user must determine what dependencies are missing and resolve them by installing the required software[5](https://paperpile.com/c/4vBDtY/kjwlC).
Even in cases where the end-user is familiar with this process, they are typically installing on high-performance clusters where they are constrained by user-level permissions that prevent them from following standard installation procedures.



- root access limitations
- reproducibility of findings
- version conflicts
- dependency resolution

### Definitions and explanations of distribution system types
- package managers

**Schematic showing standard package contents.**
Though the exact contents varies between different package formats, all include the software and relevant metadata necessary to complete installation.

**Standard workflow for installing software via a package manager.**
The user, usually an admin, asks the package manager to install a specific piece of software. If the software is not already installed, the package manager fetches the approrpriate package from the repository. If any of the dependencies are not already installed, the package manager "loops" through the missing dependencies. Once all dependencies are installed, the original software is installed.

  - benefits for the developer
    - mature technology - higher degree of familiarity
    - allows dependency specification (including versions)
  -limitations for the developer
    - can't always use to install missing dependencies for end-user
  - benefits for the end-user
    - package size is minimal (dependencies aren't duplicated)
    - installs missing dependencies
  - limitations for the end-user
    - not always accessible (unless admin user)
    - can't install multiple versions of same software

  - benefits for the developer
    - include specific versions of dependencies
    - known running environment
      - fewer test variables
      - reproducibility of results
  - limitations for the developer
    - learn a new system instead of focusing on research
  - benefits for the end-user
    - no installation (except possible runtime)
    - no dependency issues
    - sandbox provides computer system security
  - limitations for the end-user
    - container size
    - duplication of dependencies
    - root access requirement to install runtime
    - configuration in cluster
- centralized repositories
  - definition
  - benefits
    - known download site
    - hosting is taken of
  - limitations
    - repo specific restrictions
